              Your rising sign is your "mask"‚Äîthe personality you wear when meeting new people or entering new situations.
              It\'s not fake; it\'s your natural defense mechanism and the way you navigate the world. Over time, you grow into
              your rising sign qualities more fully. While your Sun sign is who you are at your core, your rising sign is how
              you present that core to the world. Together with your Moon sign (emotional nature), these three signs form the
              foundation of your astrological identity.
